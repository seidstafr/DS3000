# Visual Percept Community & Transition Classifier
NIfTI -> csv file conversion center for doi:10.18112/openneuro.ds001621.v1.1.0
This is an example output of our file conversion process. Our full dataset consists of 100 NIfTI files
(almost all of which are larger than 50 GB) and 100 tsv files (all 9 KB). With the help of the nibabel
and nilearn fMRI data processing libraries, we can operate on the NIfTI files directly. This is easier
than using the csv format because conversion to csv increases file size by about a factor of 4.
We received approval from the instructor, Caglar Yildirim, to present an example of a converted csv file
along with the script I wrote to convert it as our dataset deliverable since the full dataset is too
large to upload to either Blackboard or GitHub. Here we demonstrate competence in file conversion.
